<center><h2>Welcome to Direct Online Services LTD</h2></center>
<p>
Based in Gloucestershire in the United Kingdom, Direct Online Services Limited (DOS LTD) is the e-commerce retailer behind a range of well-known 
kitchen furniture brands, including Worktop Express®, Solid Wood Kitchen Cabinets, WEX Trade and deTerra. <br><br>

Direct Online Services LTD was founded by father and son team Martyn and Will Rees in 2008 with the aim of providing high-quality solid wood kitchen components at affordable prices. The company has grown considerably since the launch of flagship brand Worktop Express® - which now offers the largest stocked range of wood worktops in the UK - and now markets a comprehensive range of products direct to the public via a portfolio of nine websites, three eBay shops, six showrooms, and depots across the UK . 
A successful in-house two-man delivery service was launched in 2011 and continues to grow. <br><br>

Whilst Worktop Express remains the flagship brand, newer brands Solid Wood Kitchen Cabinets and deTerra continue the DOS ethos of promoting ethically-sourced, solid wood products, 
but this time in the form of solid oak kitchens - the components of which are all available to be ordered online, providing customers with a 'one-stop shop' for choosing and ordering their dream kitchen online. <br><br>

We have always taken a forward-thinking approach to business, which has led the company to thrive since its formation. In October 2016, we were pleased to secure a substantial investment from the Business Growth Fund, 
allowing us to invest further in our staff, infrastructure, operations and marketing. With the investment we plan to expand the international presence of our flagship brand, Worktop Express, and become the leading online worktop retailer in Europe. <br><br>
